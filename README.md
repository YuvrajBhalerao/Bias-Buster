üéØ The Problem: The Unseen Bias in Small Datasets

In the world of data science, fairness is not a default feature. Small teams and individual developers often work with datasets containing hidden biases they don't have the resources to uncover. These biases‚Äîstemming from imbalanced classes, skewed features, or unrepresentative samples‚Äîcan lead to machine learning models that are not only inaccurate but also perpetuate and amplify societal inequities. The result? Unfair outcomes, discriminatory predictions, and a loss of trust.

‚ú® The Solution: An Intelligent Fairness Toolkit

Bias Buster is a user-friendly web application that acts as your "Grammarly for dataset quality." It empowers developers and data scientists to quickly upload their datasets and receive an instant, interactive report that highlights potential fairness issues. More than just a detector, Bias Buster provides actionable, context-aware suggestions for data augmentation and preprocessing, making it easy to build more equitable and robust models.

üöÄ Live Preview

Below is a snapshot of the interactive report generated by Bias Buster. The dashboard provides a clear summary, detailed visualizations of potential issues, and concrete suggestions for mitigation.

üîë Key Features

Effortless Dataset Upload: A simple drag-and-drop or file-picker interface for your CSV files.

Automated Bias Detection: Runs a suite of tests to identify three critical types of bias:

Class Imbalance: Detects when a target variable is heavily skewed towards one outcome.

Feature Skewness: Finds numerical features with non-normal distributions that can mislead models.

Missing Representation: Identifies columns with significant amounts of missing data.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes findings with clear, interactive charts (powered by Chart.js) for easy interpretation.

Actionable Recommendations: Provides specific, easy-to-understand suggestions (e.g., "Use SMOTE for column 'X'", "Apply a Log Transform to column 'Y'") to fix the identified issues.

üî¨ Methodology: How It Works

The application's core logic is a three-step pipeline designed for clarity and actionability:

Load & Validate (data_handler.py): The system first ingests the user's CSV file, validating its structure and loading it into a Pandas DataFrame. This initial step ensures data integrity before analysis.

Detect (detector.py): The core analysis module scrutinizes the DataFrame for common bias indicators:

Imbalance: It iterates through categorical columns, calculating the ratio between the majority and minority classes. If this ratio exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 80/20 split), it's flagged as imbalanced.

Skewness: For numerical columns, it calculates the statistical skewness. A value significantly far from 0 (e.g., > |1.0|) indicates a feature distribution that could disproportionately influence a model.

Missing Data: It calculates the percentage of null values for each column, flagging those with significant data gaps that could lead to biased learning.

Suggest (suggester.py): Based on the flags from the detection phase, this module generates tailored advice. It maps specific problems to proven data science solutions, translating complex statistical findings into straightforward, actionable steps for the user.
